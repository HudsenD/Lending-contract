# Lending Protocol

This is a minimalistic lending contract that allows users to deposit funds
and take out loans using the deposited funds as collateral. It is an overcollateralized platform that requires users to have a Loan-to-value ratio of 80% or less, otherwise they run the risk of being liquidated. To prevent instant liquidation upon minor price movements, users can only borrow up to 75% LTV.
